Some notes as to how I would carry out Pull Requests...

Just in terms of code quality, would set up SonarQube so it can detect any technical debt and identify any code that might have security breaches. - I did attempt to set up SQ and tried to link my github to SQ but was having issues with the pem file. I created a github app for the api url that is a requirement, installed the app, and set up permissions. but connectivity with auth with SQ failed with the private key. i might try fix later.

on that note, I will proceed with comments within the solution.
